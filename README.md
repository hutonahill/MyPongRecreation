# Overview

The goal of this project was to familiarize myself with GoDot with C#.

I created a basic version of pong

I chose pong because its a great starting point for a game> it has player controlled parts, scoring and other moving parts

# Development Environment

I used The GoDot game engine and Visual Studio Code

GoDot uses a version of C# with a bunch of new methods.
